# Moloch - part.2

This project is based on Moloch, with a few modifications made to meet the prerequisites of the VLSI 2 course at ETH. Three small memories were added to the hardware accelerator, containing our names, and the overall chip size was increased (2235 Âµm Ã— 2235 Âµm).

The work was carried out in collaboration with another student. Since we had additional time, we extended the chip development and performed partial LVS and DRC verification. Due to technical issues, however, a complete verification could not be finalized.

Except for these small modifications, the rest of the project remains unchanged. For further details, please refer to the [Moloch Github page](https://github.com/Nikola-Tesi/croc_with_SHA_256)


If you are curious, the full report submitted for VLSI 2 can be found here: [ðŸ“„ Download VLSI 2 Report PDF](doc/VLSI2_Report.pdf).

The part I personally find most interesting is related to the DRC errors.
